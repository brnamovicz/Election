# Election
Ben Namovicz

This is a repository for my analysis of an article by Steve Cortes. The article claims to provide statistical evidence that calls into question the results of the 2020 US Presidential election, but none of his arguments hold up to basic analysis.

You can download the Jupyter Notebook containing all the data, code, and results from this repository as a zip file, or view the notebook [here](https://brnamovicz.github.io/Election/)
