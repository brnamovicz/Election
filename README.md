# Election
Ben Namovicz

This is a repository for my analysis of an article by Steve Cortes. The article claims to provide statistical evidence that calls into question the results of the 2020 US Presidential election, but none of his arguments hold up to basic analysis.

You can download a zip file with the Jupyter Notebook and another zip file with all the datasets I used from this repository. You can view the notebook [here](https://brnamovicz.github.io/Election/)
